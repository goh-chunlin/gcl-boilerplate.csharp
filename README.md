# GCL Boileterplate in C#

## Objective
This is a project that aims to assist me to come up with solutions quickly in certain use cases, such as creating a console application to parse a CSV file, etc. Those are simple yet frequent use cases in my career as well as personal projects. This will also help giving my friends who are working on similar use cases in their life to get started quickly.

## Useful Tips
1. Get CSharp versions supported.\
   `csc -langversion:?`
